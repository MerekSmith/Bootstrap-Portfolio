						<p>I have just graduated from the 24 month long University of Utah Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp program. In the
							course, the focus was on learning the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React, and Node). I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript
							as the main languages to go along with several different technologies. More details on this, including all topics
							that were covered can be found through the link on the UofU certification that is displayed in the Certificates box.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I currently work as a Supply Chain Analyst at 	Overstock.com. However, I am pursuing becoming a full time developer and coding ninja. Now that I am graduated, I am continuing to educate myself by cleaning up my class projects and working on new websites. So far I am enjoying web development but am interested in Java and learning about other types of development.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I have a new found passion for board games and own nearly 80 different games so far. I really enjoying playing board games
							with my family and friends. I have a special collection of kids games to play with my 5 year old daughter. She can
							now play some advanced games and seems to really enjoy that time together. I find it to be a very engaging activity and love strategic, abstract, puzzely games. I also really enjoying weight
							lifting and playing Racquetball. I have two kids, a 4 year old daughter and 3 month old son.</p>
